# Web Development and Design Coding Challenge

Hi ðŸ‘‹ ! Thanks for considering Bigeye! We're excited you've decided to interview with us.

For this portion of your interview, you will be live-coding a product page. The designs for these pages will be in a Figma document sent to you separately from this repository.

## Overview

We're making a product page for our fictional friends at Soundz. This page showcases their new product, the Soundz MC-002. Your job is to make the product page for this.

## Running the environment

This project is a `create-react-app` scaffold. To set up the project, install all project dependencies with `npm install`. You should then be able to work on the code with the command `npm run start`.

We've already scraped out a few images from the design, and they are in the `public/images` folder:

- `soundz-logo.png` is the company logo for the top menu
- `mc-002.png` is the product picture with the dotted background
- `play.svg` is the play icon

As this is `create-react-app`, you can use CSS and CSS Modules. If you wish to use Sass, you can install it with `npm install sass`. [More info about Sass](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet) can be found in the CRA docs.

## Your task

Your task is to create this page. You will have to create the following pieces:

- The menu at the top
- The product header with microphone image
- The product details and technical specifications
